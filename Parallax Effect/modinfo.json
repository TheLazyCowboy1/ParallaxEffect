  "description": "Implements a basic parallax-like effect using a shader, making the world look a lot more 3-dimensional.<LINE><LINE>Compatible with SBCameraScroll! Although intended for the vanilla camera, this mod works in conjunction with SBCameraScroll; so now you can have both smooth scrolling and depth perception!<LINE><LINE>Offers a lot of configuration options in the mod's remix config menu. The very first option directly scales the intensity of the parallax effect. The other options... Good luck!<LINE><LINE>Slight frame drops guaranteed (although there is some option for \"optimization\"). Use at your own risk.",
